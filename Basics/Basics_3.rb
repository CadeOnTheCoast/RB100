#This code shows how to make a hash (AKA dict) print out all the values of the hash line by line
# print method could be used to make them print on same line
# could also call each key i.e. "Gone_with_the_Wind" to make it print each value -
# ^ this is the way the RB100 book shows in the solution but is obviously less elegant

movies = {Gone_with_the_Wind: 1939,
  Avatar: 2009,
  Titanic: 1997,
  StarWars: 1977}
